                    <li class="ingredient-item"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup honey</li>
                    <li class="ingredient-item"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li class="ingredient-item">1 pinch salt</li>
                    <li class="ingredient-item">3 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
                    <li class="ingredient-item">1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, melted</li>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <h3 class="step">Step 1</h3>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone liner (such as SilpatÂ®).</p>
            <h3 class="step">Step 2</h3>
            <p>Place almonds into the bowl of a food processor; alternate pulsing and running at full speed every few seconds
                until finely chopped and crumblike. Be careful not to go too far; you don't want them too fine and pasty.</p>
            <h3 class="step">Step 3</h3>
            <p>Combine butter, brown sugar, and honey in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir a few times and cook until melted and
                dissolved. Bring to a boil, then carefully remove from the heat.</p>
            <h3 class="step">Step 4</h3>
            <p>Add vanilla extract, salt, and flour, and whisk until smooth. Add chopped almonds and mix with a spatula until
                everything is combined.</p>
            <h3 class="step">Step 5</h3>
            <p>Drop eight uniformly sized, rounded spoonfuls of batter (each about 2 teaspoons, or 15 grams) onto the prepared
                sheet. Fine-tune the cookie shapes and make sure they are evenly spaced.</p>
            <h3 class="step">Step 6</h3>
            <p>Place in the center of the preheated oven and bake until golden brown and a bit darker around the outsides, 10 to
                12 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through.</p>
            <h3 class="step">Step 7</h3>
            <p>Remove from the oven and slide the silicone liner off the baking sheet and directly onto the countertop. Allow to
                sit until cool and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes, then gently peel cookies off the liner. Repeat to bake remaining
                batches.</p>
            <h3 class="step">Step 8</h3>
            <p>Spread melted chocolate over the flat side of one cookie. Place a second cookie, flat-side down, on top to make a
                sandwich and press very gently to seal. Repeat to form remaining cookies. Let sit until chocolate has firmed up,
                about 30 minutes.</p>              
            <h2>Chef's Note:</h2>
            <p>You can chop the almonds by hand but it will take a lot longer.</p>
            <p>You can use any type of nuts, such as walnuts or macadamia nuts, and any type of chocolate you'd like. You can
                 skip the chocolate and eat them as is; this will result in twice as many cookies.</p>
            <p>Honey adds a pronounced caramelized, burnt-honey flavor. For a milder, more neutral taste, use corn syrup in
                place of honey.</p>
            <p>If you let your melted chocolate cool a bit and get a little thicker, you can avoid the chocolate squeezing out
                through the holes of the cookies.</p>
